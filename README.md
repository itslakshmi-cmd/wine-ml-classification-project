# 🍷 Wine Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying wine samples into different categories based on their chemical properties using machine learning classification algorithms. The project compares multiple models and evaluates their performance on the Wine dataset.

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset: Wine Dataset
- Features: Chemical attributes such as alcohol content, acidity, flavonoids, etc.
- Target: Wine class/category
- The dataset is clean with no missing values.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and feature scaling
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using multiple classifiers
